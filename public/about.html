<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Alhassan, a web developer with a passion for bringing creative ideas to life through code.</p>

 <p> My journey in web development began with a fascination for how websites are built, and I am currently engrossed in my first big project using HTML.</p>

  <p>I thrive on the challenge of creating a clean, structured, and accessible foundation for my work, and I am excited to see where this project takes me. I am a determined and detail-oriented individual who constantly seeks to expand my skills and knowledge.</p>
  <p>I find immense satisfaction in crafting engaging user experiences, and my ultimate goal is to build beautiful, functional, and impactful websites for my clients and myself.</p>
